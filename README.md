## BMO's Privacy Policy

### By using BMO Discord BOT you accept with its privacy policy. 
### 1. What does it store?
#### BMO stores the following: 
##### • Server IDs for servers data (prefixes, and other settings like logging, automod and so on), blacklist.
##### • User IDs for blacklist, temporary mutes and suggestions.

### 2. Who can access the data?
#### Following people can access ALL of the data:
##### • Bot developers
#### Following people can access secret data (servers data/settings, blacklists, suggestions and bug reports):
##### • Bot administrator
##### • Bot developers
#### Following people can access moderation logs, temporary mutes:
##### • Server moderators that the user was muted/warned in
##### • Everyone who has access to the log channel (Administrators of that discord __GUILD__ may choose who may see it and normal discord __USERS__ who don't have the required permissions can not see who else has access.
#### Following people can access the command history:
##### • Everyone who is able to __read__ the text channel which the command has been run inside of.
##### • Bot Developers

### 3. How can I get rid of the data stored?
##### • To remove all suggestions please DM a bot owner or mention them inside of the __#general__ channel inside of the support server

### 4. Why does it store the data?
#### It stores server IDs for settings and data because:
##### • Without those most of the bot wouldn't be functional. The loggs would break or wouldn't be customisable, you couldn't invoke any of the commands bot has.
#### It stores user IDs and guild IDs for logs, suggestions, reports, __command logs__, snipe logs:
##### • Bot needs to find the user that has the data stored in the database as - snipes, reports and return that data to them
##### • Bot needs to find the user that has data stored in database as - suggestions to know who was the owner of the suggestion and inform them when the suggestion was approved/denied. Also the users that followed that suggestion.
#### It stores server IDs and user IDs for blacklist because:
##### • We need to prevent people/servers that abuse the bot, break bot rules.

### 5. I'm questioning why do you need all this data, and this Privacy Policy doesn't answer my question. What should I do?
#### Feel free to join the [support server](https://discord.gg/sbarzRb) and/or contact EppyPrime#1461 (611108193275478018).

### Please note, that we can change this policy without any warning at any given time.
